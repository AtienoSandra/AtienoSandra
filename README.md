### Hi there, I'm **Atieno Sandra** 👋

I’m a **Data Analyst & Admin professional** with 5+ years in the healthcare sector. I thrive on transforming chaos into clarity—and if I can use data to do so, even better. To me, data isn’t just about spreadsheets and visuals; it's a symphony of stories that capture both the highs and lows of the human experience. I enjoy **discovering stories hidden in data**.

## 🧰 **Toolkit**
My toolkit includes Excel, R, STATA and I'm currently on an exciting journey to master SQL and Power BI. Every project shown here has been an eye-opener, sharpening my ability to uncover the truths data can reveal. 

## 🌱 **What I’m working on:**  
- **Building a diverse portfolio** that touches different sectors — from education, gender, and social impact to healthcare.  
- Growing my skills in **healthcare research & program management**, because that’s where my deepest passion lies.  
- Creating projects that combine **data + storytelling**, showing how numbers connect to real human experiences.  
- Exploring **Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E)** projects that turn raw data into insights for better decision-making.  

## 📌 **Projects**
*(Currently building my portfolio — here’s what’s coming!)*  

#### 🏥 Healthcare Patient Data Dashboard  
Simulated clinic dataset to track diagnoses, visit frequency, and payments. Focused on cleaning, analysis, and visualizations that help clinics improve operations.  
➡️ Repo: *coming soon*  

#### 📚 Education Impact Tracker  
Measuring teacher performance improvements (before vs. after feedback). SQL + Excel project with simple visuals that highlight the power of data in education.  
➡️ Repo: *coming soon*  

#### 💻 SQL Practice Hub  
A collection of SQL queries and exercises (joins, CTEs, window functions) documenting my learning journey.

➡️ Repo: *coming soon*  

## ✨: **Fun Facts**
When I’m not immersed in data:
- I love organizing people and things, making systems run smoother, and seeing lives touched by quality service in healthcare. 
- I’m also a proud aunty, a lover of cars and shoes, and someone who finds peace in music.
