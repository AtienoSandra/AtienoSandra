### Hey there, my name is Sandra 👋

## ⭐ **About Me**

I’m a **Data Analyst & Admin professional** with 5+ years in the healthcare sector. I thrive on transforming chaos into clarity—and if I can use data to do so, even better. To me, data isn’t just about spreadsheets and visuals; it's a symphony of stories that capture both the highs and lows of the human experience. I enjoy **discovering stories hidden in data**. *"Driven by Data Grounded in Care."*

## 🧰 **Tech & Tools**

My toolkit includes:
  - Excel,
  - R,
  - STATA
  - Currently on an exciting journey to master SQL and Power BI. 

## 🌱**What I’m Working On:**

- **Building a diverse portfolio** that touches different sectors — from education, gender, and social impact to healthcare operations.  
- Growing my skills in **healthcare research & impact evaluation**, because that’s where my deepest passion lies.  
- Creating projects that combine **data + storytelling**, showing how numbers connect to real human experiences.  
- Exploring **Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E)** projects that turn raw data into insights for better decision-making.  

## 📌 **Projects**  
Every project shown here has been an eye-opener, sharpening my ability to uncover the truths data can reveal.

## ✨**Fun Facts** 

When I’m not immersed in data:
